        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>Although the job at first doesn’t seem related to I.T. concepts, I’m grateful that it gave me exposure to how to troubleshoot hardware and software on the fly. Teaching code is a great way to master the basics and makes coding on your own a better experience! Working in a team environment builds strong communication skills that are necessary in any workplace of any industry.</p><br>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>Maintaining responsibility over a team is not as easy as one would assume; for how desirable people make the position appear, it is certainly a large amount of work!

While mandatory meetings may not be the most fun, I did enjoy talking to coworkers who had the same experiences that I did</p><br>
